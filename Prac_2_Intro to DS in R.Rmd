In this exercise, we use `R` (R Core Team 2018) and the `Distance` package (Miller 2017, Miller *et al.* 2019) to fit different detection function models to the duck nest data (introduced in Exercise 1) and estimate duck nest density and abundance.

# Objectives 

The aims of this exercise are to:

1. Load the Distance library
2. Import a data file
3. Fit a basic detection function using the `ds` function
4. Plot and examine a detection function 
5. Assess goodness of fit of the detection function
6. Fit different detection function forms.

# Survey data 

As a reminder of the survey, 20 line transects, each of length 128.75 km, were searched out to a distance of 2.4 metres (Anderson and Pospahala 1970). Perpendicular distances to detected nests have been provided in a data set named `ducknest`. The columns in the file `ducknest` are:

+ Study.Area - this is the name of the study, Monte Vista NWR
+ Region.Label - identifier of regions: in this case there is only one region and it is set to 'Default'
+ Area - size of the study region (km$^2$): here the area is set to zero \footnote{The area of the refuge is 47.7 km$^2$ - this is needed to obtain abundance: for the purposes of this exercise, we are interested in fitting detection functions and density rather than abundance.}
+ Sample.Label - line transect identifier (numbered 1-20)
+ Effort - length of the line transects (km) 
+ object - unique identifier for each duck nest identified
+ distance - perpendicular distance (metres) to each duck nest.

The distances allow different key functions/adjustments to be fitted in the detection function model and, by including the transect lengths and area of the region, density and abundance can be estimated. 

# Using the `Distance` package

The `Distance` package (Miller 2017) has been installed in RStudio/Cloud.  When you work on your own machine, you will need to install it with this pair of commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(remotes)
remotes::install_github("DistanceDevelopment/Distance")
```


# Accessing the data

The duck nest data are part of the `Distance` package, so if you have the package installed, the data set can be accessed simply by using the `data()` function

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(Distance)
data(ducknest)
```

To look at the first few rows of `ducknest` type the following command. 

```{r,echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
head(ducknest)
```

The object `ducknest` is a dataframe object made up of rows and columns. There is one row for each detected nest: use the function `nrow` to remind yourself how many detections there are:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nrow(ducknest)
```

# Summarising the perpendicular distances

Create a numerical summary of the distances:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
summary(ducknest$distance)
```

Similarly to plot a histogram of distances, the command is:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5}
hist(ducknest$distance, xlab="Distance (m)")
```


# Fitting a simple detection function model with `ds`

Detection functions are fitted using the `ds` function and this function requires a data frame to have a column called `distance`. We have this in our `ducknest` data, therefore, we can simply supply the name of the data frame to the function as follows. 

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Careful!</strong> A guaranteed way to produce incorrect results from your analysis is to misspecify the units distances are measured.  The `ds` function has an argument `convert.units` where the user provides a value to report density in proper units.  Providing an incorrect value will result in estimates that are out by orders of magnitude.
</div>


Before fitting a model, the units of measure within the survey need to be reconciled.   We can choose the units in which duck nest density is to be reported, we choose *square kilometres*.  How to import this information to the `ds` function?  

The answer is another function `convert_units`.  Arguments to this function are

- distance_units	
  - units of measure for perpendicular/radial distances
- effort_units	
  - units of measure for effort (NULL for point transects)
- area_units	
  - units of measure for the study area.


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
conversion.factor <- convert_units("meter", "kilometer", "square kilometer")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=answer}
# Fit half-normal detection function, no adjustment terms
nest.hn <- ds(data=ducknest, key="hn", adjustment=NULL,
              convert.units=conversion.factor)
```

Details about the arguments for this function:

+ `key="hn"`
  - fit a half-normal key detection function
+ `adjustment=NULL` 
  - do not include adjustment terms
+ `convert.units=conversion.factor` 
  - required because, for this example, the perpendicular distances are in metres and the line transect lengths are in km - this argument converts the perpendicular distance measurements from metres to km.

As we have seen, on executing the `ds` command some information is provided to the screen reminding the user what model has been fitted and the associated AIC value. More information is supplied if we ask for a summary of the model as follows:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=answer}
# Summarise model object
summary(nest.hn)
```

Can you match the information with the values you used in Exercise 1 - was your density estimate similar to the one obtained here?  

To look at the fitted detection function, simply use the `plot` function:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=answer, message=F, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(nest.hn)
```

The number of bins in the histogram can be changed by specifying the `nc` argument, for example, to plot the histogram having 8 bins (as in Exercise 1) we can specify:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=answer, message=F, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(nest.hn, nc=8)
```

The histogram should look like the one you drew in Exercise 1. 

# Goodness of fit 

The usual tools for checking goodness of fit are available: the function `gof_ds` performs goodness of fits tests and plots a QQ-plot. In this command, 8 bins will be used for the chi-square goodness of fit test. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=answer, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
gof_ds(nest.hn, nc=8)
```

# Specifying different detection functions

Different detection function forms and shapes, are specified by changing the `key` and `adjustment` arguments. 

The different options available for `key` detection functions are:

+ half normal (`key="hn"`) - this is the default
+ hazard rate (`key="hr"`)
+ uniform (`key="unif"`)

The different options available for adjustment terms are:

+ no adjustment terms (`adjustment=NULL`)
+ cosine (`adjustment="cos"`) - default
+ Hermite polynomial (`adjustment="herm"`)
+ Simple polynomial (`adjustment="poly"`)

For each model specified below, note down the AIC, density and 95\% confidence interval and compare it to the model already fitted (i.e. half-normal with no adjustments). Which detection function model would you choose?

To fit a uniform key function with cosine adjustment terms, use the command:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=answer, message=FALSE}
nest.uf.cos <- ds(ducknest, key="unif", adjustment="cos",
                  convert.units=conversion.factor)
```

By default, AIC selection will be used to fit adjustment terms of up to order 5. Have any adjustment terms been selected?  

To fit a hazard rate key function with Hermite polynomial adjustment terms, then use the command:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=answer, message=FALSE}
nest.hr.herm <- ds(ducknest, key="hr", adjustment="herm", 
                  convert.units=conversion.factor)
```
